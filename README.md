## 📜 What Is a Roblox Dead Rails Script?

A **Dead Rails script** is a Lua-based code that can be executed within the Roblox platform to enhance gameplay or exploit in-game mechanics. These scripts are usually injected into the Roblox client using **executors** or **exploit tools**, allowing players to access hidden or locked features that aren't available in regular gameplay.

### 💡 Common Features Found in Dead Rails Scripts:

- 🔍 **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)** – See enemies, items, or players through walls
- ⚡ **Speed Hack** – Move faster than normal characters
- 🛡️ **God Mode** – Become immune to all damage
- ✈️ **Fly Hack / Noclip** – Fly through the map or walk through walls
- ⛏️ **Auto Farm** – Automatically collect resources and complete objectives
- 🎮 **Custom GUI** – Use a user-friendly menu to toggle hacks on/off
- 🚪 **Teleport** – Instantly move anywhere in the map
- 🔒 **Anti-Ban** – Reduce the chance of getting detected by anti-cheat

Scripts offer a major boost in gameplay, especially in horror games like Dead Rails, where visibility and timing are everything.
